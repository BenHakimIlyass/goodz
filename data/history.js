        body: `Quick absorbing moisturizer that's great for summer. Ahava can be a bit pricey, but I find that you always get what you pay for with their products. I prefer oil over lotion for daily use when getting out of the shower - and this product fits the bill. There is really no such thing as "dry" oil, so if you don't like oil- or find it a bit greesy- you will not like this oil- dry or not. However, I have tried all of them... neutrogena, palmer's, Rite Aid and CVS's own brands of the various after shower oils. It is a bit pricier than Neutrogena's sesame or unscented oil (the closes comparable in my opinion), but Ahava does have the best fragrance. And is easier to travel with (less chance of spillling all over your clothes)`,
